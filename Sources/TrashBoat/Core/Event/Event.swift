/**
Encapsulates an event in a game, which should act as a reusable experience.  Also provides shortcuts for retrieving items and player requests in a safe way.

Should almost always be initialised as part of an `EventContainer`, and subclasses should always use the `EventRepresentible` protocol to define the event's name and type.
