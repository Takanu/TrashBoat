/**
Encapsulates an event in a game, which should act as a reusable experience.  Events provide property shortcuts for retrieving items
and player requests, enabling clearer and more readable event scripting without having to chain other types.  Subclass this type to add
your own properties and shortcuts for event scripting.

- warning: Subclasses should __always__ inherit the `EventRepresentible` protocol to define the event's core properties and methods,
and __almost always__ be initialised as part of an `EventContainer` to isolate event code and game states from unexpected changes, and to
initialise the event only when needed.
