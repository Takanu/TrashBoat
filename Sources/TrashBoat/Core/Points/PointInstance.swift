An instance of a PointType that defines the behaviour of a point including
how it is added or subtracted from, counted and displayed.

A PointInstance is ideal for tracking health, currency, turns and other scalar-type
properties.  Alternatively you can use PointManager to manage multiple types of Points
under one property in an implicit manner.
