## A suite of useful tools for building Telegram games with Pelican.

This is a collection of useful tools and types that i've built while making @SpookyPartyBot, which can be used in a variety of game designs.

I hope to add more information in the future in order to clearly illustrate, but for the time being if you're feeling adventurous, I have open-sourced one of my bots to show it in action - check out [Kingpin Roulette](https://github.com/Takanu/Kingpin-Roulette).
